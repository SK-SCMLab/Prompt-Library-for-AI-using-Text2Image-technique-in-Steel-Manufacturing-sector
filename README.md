# üó£ Prompt-Library-for-AI-using-Text2Image-technique-in-Steel-Manufacturing-sector
This repository outlines the complete steel manufacturing workflow across three major segments:
1. Hot Rolling Division (HRD)
2. Cold Rolling Division (CRD)
3. Special Product Division (SPD)

Also, this repository introduces **Text2Image* prompt engineering technique to visualize each of them pictorially using AI prompts

## üë©‚Äçü¶º Text2Image
It takes natural language input and produces a high quality image that matches the input text description. Some examples of Text2Image models are Dall-E-2 from OpenAI, Imagen from Google Research Brain Team, Stable Diffusion from Stability AI, and Midjourney. Diffusion architecture is a deep learning architecture system that learns through two-step process. The first step is called forward diffusion. Using forward diffusion, the system gradually introduces a small amount of noise to an input image until only the noise is leftover. There is a U-Net model that tracks and predicts the noise level. In the subsequent reverse diffusion step, the noisy image is gradually introduced to denoising until a new image is generated. During the training process, the model gets the feed of text, which is added to the image vector
